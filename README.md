## 👋 Hey, I’m Connor O’Brien  

I’m a **full-stack developer** who also teaches and creates technical content.  
My GitHub includes production code, experiments, and smaller repositories used to demonstrate or explain specific coding concepts while teaching.  

I build with modern web stacks and care about writing code that’s clear, maintainable, and practical — whether it’s for a real project or an example used to explain one.
